Prepare and plan it all out before market opens -> execute the plan for first two hours as the market is volatile
More volatile -> more opportunities (hardest part is patience, patience, patience)
During the day, observe the market and trade if there is good opportunity (watch youtube, news, etc)
After market closes -> Free Time

Trading plan (xFOMO) - thesis, risk reward, exit plan, keep loss in control (90% planning, 10% execution)
Over trading leads to emotional trading to revenge trading (want to get the money back!!!) -> follow your stop loss/risk profile (emotional? -> shutdown)
Walk away and take a break between 11:30 to 2:30 EST market time (tight range; low volume; x profitable) - focus on open
Spend enough time in paper trading (trading with simulated money on live charts) - Treat paper trading account as real money - get used to broker interface

Candle patterns make trading seem simple - real time indicator is the price action - observe how candle sticks change real time and how it reacts to various news
When you scale up posiiton size too quickly, it will lead to emotional trading (take it slow)
Follwing other trading decision/chatroom alerts put you behind your journey to becoming a profitable trader and train your account






What is Fundamental Analysis?
Analyzing a company's financials, competitive position, and overall market environment to estimate its fair value (intrinsic value; real value of the company)

Key Difference with Technical Analysis
FA focuses on the intrinsic value and LONG-term trends (can be short-term due to a breaking news)
TA focuses on price action and SHORT-term trends

Intrinsic Value vs. Market price
The market price can differ in the short term from a company's true worth (intrinsic value); repetition of going above and below -> buy when it is undervalued!

Macro & Industry Factors -> FA
Economic data, interest rates, and industry trends can significantly affect a stock's or crypto's performance

Financial Statements
Summaries of a company's financial performance and position essential for evaluating a company's health and growth potential.
Together, these statements give a complete picture of a company's financial health.

    Three Main Types:
    1) Income Statement: Tracks revenue (selling products & services), expenses (making products & services; overall operation, etc), and profit (revenue - expenses - taxes) ("How much money are they making?")
    2) Balance Sheet: Show assets (owns), liabilities (owes), and equity (assets - liabilities) at a specific point in time ("What do they own and owe?")
    3) Cash Flow Statement: Reveals cash inflows and outflows (operating, investing, financing activities) ("Do they manage their cash well")

Finanical Metrics
Calculations that help evaluate a company's financial health and performance.
Easier to compare companies and identify potential investments.

    1) Valuation Metrics: Indicate if a stock is expensive or cheap
            Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio = Market Price / Earnings per Share (lower P/E -> undervalued -> buy)   
            Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio = Market Price / Book Value per Share (far from perfect metric)
            Pirce-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio = Market Price / Revenue per Share (need to consider the company's growth potential)

    2) Profitability Metrics: Measure how efficiently a company generates profits
            Net Profit Margin = Net Income / Revenue (cost efficiency)
            Gross Margin = (Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue (production efficiency)

            Return on Equity (ROE) = Net Income / Shareholder's Equity (efficient use of investor's money)
            Return on Assets (ROA) = Net Income / Total Assets (efficient use of assets)

    3) Growth Metrics: Highlight a company's potental for future expansion
