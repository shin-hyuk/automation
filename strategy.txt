## Core Components

### 1. Portfolio Management
- Maintains positions for both long and short trades
- Tracks:
  - Cash balance
  - Margin usage
  - Position sizes
  - Cost basis for long/short positions
  - Realized gains/losses

### 2. Trade Execution System

#### Long Positions
- Buy: 
  - Cost = quantity * current_price
  - Limited by available cash
  - Updates cost basis using weighted average
- Sell:
  - Limited by owned shares
  - Realizes gains/losses based on average cost basis
  - Formula: realized_gain = (current_price - avg_cost) * quantity

#### Short Positions
- Short:
  - Proceeds = quantity * current_price
  - Margin required = proceeds * margin_ratio
  - Net cash effect = proceeds - margin_required
  - Updates short cost basis using weighted average
- Cover:
  - Cost = quantity * current_price
  - Releases proportional margin
  - Formula: realized_gain = (short_cost_basis - current_price) * quantity
  - Net cash effect = -cover_cost + released_margin

### 3. Portfolio Valuation
Formula: Total Value = Cash + Long Value + Short PnL
- Cash: Available cash balance
- Long Value: sum(long_shares * current_price)
- Short PnL: sum(short_shares * (short_cost_basis - current_price))

### 4. Performance Metrics

#### Risk Metrics
- Sharpe Ratio = √252 * (mean_excess_return / std_excess_return)
  - Excess return = daily_return - risk_free_rate
  - Risk-free rate = 4.34% annually

- Sortino Ratio = √252 * (mean_excess_return / downside_std)
  - Downside std = standard deviation of negative returns only

- Maximum Drawdown = min((portfolio_value - rolling_max) / rolling_max) * 100

#### Exposure Metrics
- Long Exposure = sum(long_positions * current_prices)
- Short Exposure = sum(short_positions * current_prices)
- Gross Exposure = Long Exposure + Short Exposure
- Net Exposure = Long Exposure - Short Exposure
- Long/Short Ratio = Long Exposure / Short Exposure
