Prepare and plan it all out before market opens -> execute the plan for first two hours as the market is volatile
More volatile -> more opportunities (hardest part is patience, patience, patience)
During the day, observe the market and trade if there is good opportunity (watch youtube, news, etc)
After market closes -> Free Time

Trading plan (xFOMO) - thesis, risk reward, exit plan, keep loss in control (90% planning, 10% execution)
Over trading leads to emotional trading to revenge trading (want to get the money back!!!) -> follow your stop loss/risk profile (emotional? -> shutdown)
Walk away and take a break between 11:30 to 2:30 EST market time (tight range; low volume; x profitable) - focus on open
Spend enough time in paper trading (trading with simulated money on live charts) - Treat paper trading account as real money - get used to broker interface

Candle patterns make trading seem simple - real time indicator is the price action - observe how candle sticks change real time and how it reacts to various news
When you scale up posiiton size too quickly, it will lead to emotional trading (take it slow)
